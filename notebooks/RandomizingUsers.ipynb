The latter case happens when we want to test two potentially interacting ideas and ensure that a user isn't exposed to the cross product of possible outcomes simultaneously. "

    "* Ramp Up and Ramp Down: We need to be able to quickly change allocations including killing experiments that show problems.\n",
    "* Experiment Exclusion: We can configure two experiments to not overlap if we want. A user in treatment or control for experiment 1 will not be in treatment or control for experiment 2. (Aside: I know you could share controls. Let's keep it simple.)\n",

    "* Stratification: Is stratified sampling possible? (The original topic of Netflix's paper).\n",

What I'm calling statistical efficiency is really judging whether the system can avoid accidentally biasing the random split. We can usually detect when that bias occurs (which I'll discuss below) but such failure require an experiment rerun which reduces our efficiency. Therefore a system where more random allocations are usable in production would be better.\n",

    "The distribution of treatments to controls follows a chi-square distribution, which implies that there is no *structural* imbalance between the count of treatments and the count of controls in my implementation. However, there is still *random* fluctuation: our worst imbalance in 10000 tries was 2419 treatments, 2368 controls, and 5213 not-assigned with a p-value of 8.83e-5. I argue that this doesn't matter. The important property of a randomization engine is that it produce two samples such that the probability of assignment is independent of any user property that could correlate with the outcome of interest. Consider the extreme case: let's say we use a biased coin to assign groups that turns up heads 55% of the time. Can we use that coin in an A/B test? Yes iff the coin bias not be correlated with anything else in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our randomizer isn't inherently biased, one of the most important checks one can run at analysis time is a Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) check: always verify that the randomization engine is producing the expected sample ratio of treatments and controls by using a chi-squared test to check the null hypothesis that your sample ratio is correct. We've seen many cases of this failing due to misconfiguration, logging or cooking problems, or poorly designed experiment trigger conditions. Since we use a chi-squared test to check for SRMs, we run a slight risk of rejecting valid experimental results due to the natural false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a slight advantage to Netflix's queue system: there is no chance of an unnecessary rejection due to false positive rate in the sample ratio check. Since their distributions have a near absolute balance, one can easily verify that observed sample ratios meet the designation (though they still need to check since usually SRMs are traced to something other than the randomizer.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three reasons why I don't think this is a big deal. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) True positives tend to be extreme. When we have identified true positive SRMs in the past, the p-value tended to be below a reasonable false positive rate (say, below 1e-5). This is due to the high statistical power associated with a chi-square test in an experiment with hundreds of thousands to millions of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) If a significant percentage of the user base is not new during experiment time, one can try multiple experiment-specific salts in the event of an SRM in pre-experiment data. In other words, I can efficiently reject salts that cause randomly low p-values in my SRM test prior to committing traffic to my experiment. (Caveat: make sure to verify post-hoc that your initial salt choices are maintaining a Chi-square distribution!) \n",
    "\n",
    "3) As Netflix describes, introducing stratification or a distributed queue tends to lead to a more \"spread\" in treatment/control counts since the perfect balance a queue guarantees only exists within a single queue. In reality, Netflix is using a distributed queue. But again, this random fluctuation doesn't matter other than making verification more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second choice above doesn't help for experiments with new users, which is an important moment where Netflix and many other companies are particularly interested in experimentation. However, most problems are due to bad logging or trigger conditions, not due to a biased randomizer."
